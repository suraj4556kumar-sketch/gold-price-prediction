## **Modeling Techniques**
The following models were explored and compared:
- **Linear Regression:** Simple regression model for baseline predictions.  
- **Ridge Regression:** Regularized regression to handle overfitting.  
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble method for robust predictions.  

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**
Key evaluation metrics used:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
- **R-Squared Score (R²)**
